Unlike most other information in OpenGroove, local messages are stored as files in a folder, with a specific format, instead of as proxystorage objects. The message header and body are stored as one file, named content, which is located in a folder that has the name of the url-encoded message id. Each attachment is stored under that folder




Ideas for sequence of order:

header
 sent date
 recipients
 in reply to [empty if not in reply]
 properties
body
 content type
 subject
 message
attachments
 attachment count
 [for each attachment]
  filename
  type - file, folder, voice
  hascontents [always true for transferred messages]
  hassaved [always false for transferred messages]
  properties
  content length
 [for each attachment]
  content [empty if hascontents is empty]
