To join the game, when the game is not in progress, click Join. If you have joined a game, and it has
not started yet, but you do not want to participate, click Leave. When there are enough people, the Start
button will be enabled. You (or any other participant in the game) can click Start to start the game.
The screen will then show you game-specific information (for example, if the game is Othello, it will show you
an Othello board), as well as the current user in the game.<br/>

If you think that the information being shown you (such as the current board, current player, etc) is out of date,
click on Advanced -> Reload State, to see if that works. Normally you won't have to use this, but if your network
had a glitch, your game board might get out of sync. That's when this menu item comes in useful. If you still have
a problem, Report it to us. Go to the launchbar, and click on Help -> Contact us.
