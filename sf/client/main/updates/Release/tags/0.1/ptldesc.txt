MORE RAMBLING FROM ME ON HOW INTOUCH3 WORKS

in particular, this document is on how tool plugins are installed, and the Public Add-on list and what that means.

I wrote down in other documentation (i think) that plugins are simply jar files placed in the plugins folder, with special data
in their manifest file. there are currently 3 types of plugins, tool, workspace, and lookandfeel, with 1 more
coming soon (lookandfeel and feature). Anyway, plugins currently cannot be uninstalled once they are there. This
will hopefully change soon.

There is an option in InTouch 3 (probably somewhere on the InTouch 3 menu on the launchbar) where you
can open a dialog that will somehow contact the InTouch 3 server or the Trivergia internal web server (trivergia.com:8080)
and retrieve a list of plugins that can be downloaded. The user can then view the list and choose to download
and install any of the plugins in that list that they do not already have. A method on the InTouch 3 class can
also be called that will show the window, but with a customized title bar, message, and only show plugins
of a particular type. This will be useful, for example, in Tool workspaces, so the user can click on a button
that allows them to get new tools. the resulting dialog would show them only new tool plugins, not new workspaces
or looks and feels.

The Public Add-on List url is downloaded. it is a properties file. each key within it represents a category of
plugins, and the key's value is a pipe-separated list of update sites, one for each plugin within that category. the user
can choose which plugins they wish to install. these plugins will be downloaded and placed in the plugins folder,
and, upon restart, will become active.
