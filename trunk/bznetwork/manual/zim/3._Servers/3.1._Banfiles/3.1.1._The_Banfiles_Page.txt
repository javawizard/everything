====== 1. The Banfiles Page ======
Created Saturday 22 August 2009

The banfiles page is where you can create banfiles, delete banfiles, and manage the bans in those banfiles.

When this page first loads, it contains a list of existing banfiles, with //ban// and //delete// links next to each banfile. At the end of the page is a text field that you can use to create new banfiles.

A banfile cannot be deleted if any servers use that banfile. You will have to set those servers to use another banfile in the Servers screen before you can delete a banfile.
