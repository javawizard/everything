For my first DataStore that I'm writing for JPathDB, I'm going to have it backed by a SQLite database. Once I take a database class at the university (I'm currently attending the University of Utah), I'll write a data store that does everything by itself without relying on another database.

Types, by the way, are 1 = null, 2 = boolean, 3 = number, 4 = string, 5 = list, and 6 = object. The root object has id zero. Objects of different types can share the same id.

So, we have a few tables:

objects:

This holds a single row for each object in the database.

	id integer primary key autoincrement: The id of the object
	parent integer: The parent of this object; unspecified for the root object



objectentries:

This holds a single row for every entry in every object in the database.

	id integer: The id of the object to which this entry belongs
	key text: The key of this object
	type int8: The type of the value for this entry
	value integer: The id of this entry's value



lists:

This holds a single row for each list in the database.

	id integer primary key autoincrement: The id of the list
	parent integer: The parent of this list



listvalues:

This holds a single row for every value in every list in the database.

	id integer: The id of the list to which this value belongs
	position integer: The position of this value in the list; zero-based
	type int8: The type of the value
	value integer: The id of this value



strings:

This holds a single row for every string in the database.

	id integer primary key autoincrement: The id of the string
	parent integer: The parent of this string
	content text: The actual text of this string



numbers:

This holds a single row for every number in the database.
	
	id integer primary key autoincrement: The id of the number
	parent integer: The parent of this number
	value real: The value of this number



booleans:

This holds a single row for every boolean in the database.

	id integer primary key autoincrement: The id of the boolean
	parent integer: The parent of this boolean
	value boolean: The value of this boolean



nulls:

This holds a single row for every null in the database.

	id integer primary key autoincrement: Thd id of the null
	parent integer: The parent of this null



That should be it! At some point I'd like to compress that down a lot so that every single boolean, for example, doesn't have to have its own identifier. That'll hopefully come at some point.
