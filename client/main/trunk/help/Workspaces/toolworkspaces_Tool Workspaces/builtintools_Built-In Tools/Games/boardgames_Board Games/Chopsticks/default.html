Chopsticks is a game played with 2 people, usually using the hands. each person starts with one finger up on
either hand. for your turn, you can tap one of your hands agains one of your opponent's hands. when this happens, your opponent
has to add the number of fingers currently on their hand and on your hand and hold up that many fingers. the amount of fingers
loops, meaning that if your opponent is holding up 4 fingers on one hand, and you are holding 3, and you tap their hand,
they should now hold up 2 fingers. 5 fingers is not allowed, this loops around to 0. a hand with 0 fingers on it cannot
be used. instead of tapping one of your opponent's hands for your turn, if you have no fingers up on one hand and an even
number of fingers up on the other, you can tap your hands together and split the number of fingers. for example,
if you have 0 fingers on one hand and 4 on the other, you can split that into 2 fingers for each hand. the game is over
when one of the players has 0 fingers on both hands, and the other player is the winner.
