Servers will have a config file. Groups will have a config file that is 
either applied before or after the server's config, probably depending
on a particular setting for that group. If options are specified on both
a group and a server that conflict, the server wins. For example, if the
group and the server specify -lagdrop, the server's version will be used.
If both the group and the server specify help pages, the set of help pages
will be merged, except where both the group and the server specify the same
help page name, in which case the server's version will be used. How this
overriding thing should work with boolean values is tricky. For example,
how does a server specify that it should require udp when its group says
that it shouldn't, and another server specify that it shouldn't require udp
when its group specifies that it should? Perhaps the options should have a
checkbox next to them that specifies whether that option should be used.
Another thing that could be done is to have no checkboxes, but instead have
a dropdown box that has "require udp", "don't require udp", and "" in it.
The blank option would cause the server to inherit from its group. I'm kinda
liking the "enable" checkbox idea more, though. Groups would also have this, 
and unchecking it means that the group default is not to use that bzflag
command-line switch at all. 

Also make sure that certain options are disabled when not applicable. For
example, -c and -cr can't both be used at the same time.

   Maybe it would be worth it to figure out how to add controls in a way that 
   you just change a simple string to change what group a control is in and 
   what order within the group the control falls under. Maybe that would also 
   allow bznetwork server owners to specify what groups these all appear under.
