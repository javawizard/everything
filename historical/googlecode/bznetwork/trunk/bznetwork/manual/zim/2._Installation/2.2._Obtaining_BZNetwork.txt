====== 2. Obtaining BZNetwork ======
Created Saturday 22 August 2009

As of the writing of this manual, there are not currently any BZNetwork downloads available. I hope to make a download available soon. In the mean time, you will have to check out BZNetwork yourself and build it from source. I'm not going to cover that here, since I intend to have a download available shortly; if a download is not available yet, contact me as described in the introduction.
