<h2>Configuration</h2><p>The configuration page can be used to change general configuration settings for your site. These settings apply to all users visiting your site, not just you. Most of these settings also require that you log out and log back in for them to take effect on your account.</p><p>Some of the settings are so-called sensitive settings. These are settings that could potentially allow someone to gain access to the physical server that your site is running on. These settings have a <b>Disable Changes</b> button next to them. Clicking this button will (after asking you to confirm that you really want to disable changes) disable changes to those fields. The only way to re-enable changes is to delete a certain file on your server (the file's name and path are mentioned on the configuration page itself).</p><p>To find out more information about a particular setting, hover over the setting's name in the configuration page with your mouse. A tooltip will pop up telling you more about what that setting does.<br></p></body></html>
