The technotes folder is a folder that holds random technical information. When I'm making a complicated change to OpenGroove, I'll typically create a file in this folder, and type ideas related to the change until I've come up with a good solution.

Files in this folder (and files in folders in this folder) should be plain-text documents, not rich text. This document is a great example of the format that documents should be in. Paragraphs are not indented, and are separated by a blank line. Hard line breaks should not be included, so the line wrap functionality of the editor will be in charge of where line breaks appear.

Technotes should generally be named something that reflects their purpose. The date that the technote was created is not included in the technote's name, and generally isn't included in the technote itself, although it can be included if it makes a significant difference to the meaning of the technote. If you're wondering when a technote was created, go look up it's history in the SVN repository.
