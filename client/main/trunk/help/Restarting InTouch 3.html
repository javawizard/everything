It's probably a good idea to read through and copy these instructions, because when you exit InTouch 3, the help viewer
will close also. To restart InTouch 3, right click on the taskbar icon, and click Exit. Then, go to your desktop and double-click
InTouch 3. Depending on how InTouch 3 was set up, the icon may instead be on your start menu, or in your startup folder. To view your
startup folder, click on the start menu, click on programs, click on Startup, and then click on InTouch 3.
