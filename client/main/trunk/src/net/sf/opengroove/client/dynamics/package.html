The OpenGroove Dynamics system is a set of classes that allows multiple users to keep a large amount of information in sync,&nbsp;without having a central location where a "master copy" of the data is stored,&nbsp;and those users are frequently disconnected from the internet.

The dynamics system works on the principle that data can be represented by an initial state for that data and a set of modifications to that data, ordered consistantly among users. The dynamics system has a concept of "commands", which are instructions to "engines", the backing data storage system, on how to modify their data. A command, when executed, generates a "revert command", which provides instructions on how to revert that command, should the need arise. Then, if a command is received from another user that has a timestamp before some commands that have already been executed, those commands are reverted, the new command applied, and the commands just reverted are re-performed again. This ensures that all users will see the same set of data on their computers when they have synchronized.
