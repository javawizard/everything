The events that are going to be implemented by the plugin are:

ban
filteredChatMessage (done)
capture
playerDie**
playerSpawn**
rawChatMessage
unknownSlashCommand
listServerUpdate?
hostBanNotify
hostBanModify
idBan
kick
kill** (compare with playerDie, maybe only have one of them)
teamkill (done)
playerPaused** (can be used to detect F5ing)
messageFiltered (compare with filteredChatMessage)
gameStart
gameEnd
slashCommand
playerAuth
serverMsg
anointRabbit**?
newRabbit**?
reload
logging
flagTransferred*
flagGrabbed*
flagDropped*
playerCollision (if this refers to physical collision, remove it; if it refers to nick collision, keep it)
flagReset
reportFiled
teleport*

* These can be enabled by a parameter to the plugin itself. This makes it so that the bznetwork user can set whether or not they want to see those events. A busy server would benefit from improved performance with this disabled.
** These are enabled by default, but a parameter can be passed into the plugin to disable them. Servers which need super-speedy performance can disable these.
