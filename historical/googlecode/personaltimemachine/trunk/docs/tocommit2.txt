This is the new documentation on how we commit. Most stuff is the same as in
tocommit.txt, so I won't mention everything here.

The main difference lies in how files that exist in both revisions are compared. The 
head is stored line-encoded. Then, when a commit happens, the working copy is copied to
tmp/lineformatted. All of the files, then, as reported to find, are line-formatted. This
folder is the one that is then diffed against the head revision. Once the revision has
been applied, the contents of the head folder are deleted, and tmp/lineformatted is
renamed to head.

When a revision is to be exported, or applied somewhere, the diffs are put together as
normal. Once everything's been restored via the diffs and command list, the whole thing
is line-unformatted, producing the final result.

New files are stored line-formatted, for ease of exporting.
