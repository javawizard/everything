/**
 * This package contains classes related to communication with the server. These classes implement the actual OpenGroove protocol. Developers wishing to create their own client or bot client (a client that isn't backed by a human user, a service that sends the current time in a message would be an example of a bot) would probably be interested in the {@link CommandCommunicator} class. OpenGroove itself uses this class for it's communication.
