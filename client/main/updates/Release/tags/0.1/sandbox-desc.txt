The sandbox folder under the OpenGroove Client folder is for developers to experiment with stuff. If a developer is going to add a class to the tests package that will need to create or modify resources used purely for testing, then those resources should be placed in the sandbox folder where possible. For example, a test class that tests out the functionality of persisting an object into a relational database would probably use an H2 database with it's folder somewhere under the sandbox folder.
