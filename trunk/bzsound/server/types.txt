This is the list of packet types. The number at the beginning is the decimal value that is assigned to that packet type. 



01 - client hello

This packet is the first one sent once communication with the server has been established, and is sent by the client. It contains the string "bzsound/1.0", followed by a newline. This allows the server to distinguish a bzsound client from an http client, and therefore potentially serve http resources over the same port in the future. 



02 - server hello

This packet is sent in response to the client's client hello packet. It contains the string "bzsound/1.0", but without a newline at the end. This is always the second packet sent.



20 - client voice update

This packet contains actual audio data from the client.
