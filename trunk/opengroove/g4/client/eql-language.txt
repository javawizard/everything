This file is the official reference for the Entity Query Language, the query language used by G4's TableEngine.

EQL is a query language that is more advanced than GQL but significantly less advanced than SQL. It is designed for use with the table engine's schema-less layout.

Basic structure:


SELECT FROM <entity-type> 
    [WHERE  <check>]
    [ORDER BY <column> ( ASC | DESC) [, <column> ( ASC | DESC ) ...]]
    [OFFSET <offset>]
    [LIMIT <limit>]
    
	

<check>      := ( <condition> | <check> ( AND | OR | NOT ) <check> ) 

<condition>  :=   <column-name> ( = | > | >= | < | <= | != | <- | -> ) 
                  ( <column-name> | <literal-value> )
