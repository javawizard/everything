The sandbox section of OpenGroove is where I put files and stuff that I'm experimenting with. For example, I'm currently working on how to use X.509 certificates for server authentication, so I'm writing some classes in the sandbox that will do stuff like create a key, sign a key, start an SSLServerSocket with that key, connect to it and check that it's key and trust stuff really is coming through, etc., which could then be moved to OpenGroove Client and OpenGroove Server, or left in the sandbox for classes that are more designed to test out stuff.
