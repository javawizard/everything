This project will contain a collection of console games, ones where you use telnet to connect to a socket and use keyboard controls to use the game, and where the game uses ansi escape codes (which I've verified work correctly in windows telnet) to draw it's graphics. My idea is to include this as an easter egg in the OpenGroove Client if it doesn't end up taking up too much processing power. I'm also thinking of using the ansi escape sequence library that I'm writing for it in a telnet-like client that could be used to connect to the opengroove client to debug stuff, and similarly with the server.
