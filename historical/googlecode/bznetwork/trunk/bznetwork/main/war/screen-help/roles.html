<h2>Roles</h2><p>The roles page is where you create roles. Roles specify what permissions certain users have on your site. For example, you could create a role called "log reader", and assign it permissions so that all users with that role can view the logs of all of your servers. By default, there is one role called <b>Administrator</b> that conatins all permissions available on your site.</p><p>Simply creating a role and adding permissions to it doesn't, by itself, allow users to log into the site. You have to apply that role to a bzflag callsign (using the <a href="callsigns.html">Callsigns</a> page), a bzflag group (using the <a href="authgroups.html">Authgroups</a> page), or an internal username first. For example, you could create a role, add permissions to that role that allow a user to view the logs of the server called "Sky-high CTF by Bambino", and then apply that role to the authgroup BZTRAINING.OWNER. Then, whenever a user signs in with a callsign, and that user is a member of the BZFlag group BZTRAINING.OWNER, that user will receive permissions to view the logs at "Sky-high CTF by Bambino".<br></p><h2>Permissions</h2><p>Each role is made up of a set of permissions. These permissions specify what users with that role can do. When a user has multiple roles, permissions are added together. For example, let's say that the role ServerOp is applied to the BZFlag group BZTRAINING.OWNER, and the role Cop is applied to the BZFlag group BZTRAINING.COP. Let's also say that ServerOp grants users permissions to start and stop all servers, and Cop grants users permissions to view the server logs. A user that is a member of both groups would be able to both view logs and start/stop servers.</p><p>When adding permissions to a role, you specify a target to which the permission is applied. This grants the specified permission on that target. Servers, groups, and banfiles are all valid targets. For example, you could apply the permission view-logs to the target MyServer (assuming MyServer is a server that you've previously created), and that would allow users with that role to view the logs of MyServer.</p><p>If you apply a permission to a parent of a certain type of target, the permission will be applied to all of the parent's child targets. For example, if you apply view-logs to a group, that will cause view-logs to be applied to all servers within that group.</p><p>It doesn't make sense to apply some permissions to targets of some levels. For example, applying rename-group (which allows a user to rename a group) to a server doesn't make sense, since it wouldn't do anything to a server (as the name implies, it lets you rename a group, not rename a server). This is where permission levels come in. Each permission has a level to which it can be applied. There is a link at the bottom of the permissions editor that shows a list of all permissions and all levels, and the level of each permission.<br></p></body></html>
