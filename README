This is a historical directory (and repository) containing the original
OpenGroove, the namesake project of my website (www.opengroove.org).

The project was originally tracked in a private subversion repository which has
since been lost to history. It was then tracked in a project on SourceForge;
the history of the project during these years is located under the sf
directory. It was then tracked on Google Code, the history of which is located
under googlecode.
