This file is used for random notes that I write down when I'm trying to think about how to do something in BZNetwork.

Support for help files and bad words files should be somewhat generic, IE there should be a mechanism to easily extend that in the future to allow for other file types. Both help pages and bad words files use the same type of mechanism, IE they are specified on groups and on servers, and servers can specify whether or not they inherit the files specified on the group. It gets somewhat complex when we consider that both of them are different in both structure and inheritance mechanism. With bad words files, the gropu has one and the sever has one, and if the server chooses to inherit its group's bad words file then they just get concatenated together. With help files, the group and the server both have a list of help files, and the server can inherit the group's help files, but if there are two help files with a conflicting name then the server's help file overrides the group's help file. But then it would probably be good if the group could be set to have some certain help files that can't be overridden by the server, and a certain permission would have to be granted to a user to allow them to remove the lock on those help files. This would be useful when a person is running a network with BZNetwork, and they want to allow another user access to the network to the extent that the user can create servers under a specified group, but the network administrator wants a help file documenting information about the network itself to be included in all servers regardless of whether the server owner tried to override it.

Bad words files would need to have a similar, anti-override mechanism (so that a server network could enforce that a particular server use at a minimum a certain list of bad words, this would also require enforcing of -filterCallsigns and -filterChat), but theirs differs in that what's being overriden is whether or not the server can opt out of inheriting the group's bad words file. Help files would also need to have this option available.

From that perspective, both ideas are different. Maybe there should be a generic solution for single files, and a generic solution for multiple named files.
