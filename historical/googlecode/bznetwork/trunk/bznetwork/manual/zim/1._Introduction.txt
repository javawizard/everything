Created Saturday 22 August 2009

This is the official BZNetwork manual. It is intended to comprehensive. This means that I'm going to make a best effort to document every last feature that BZNetwork has. If you're new to BZNetwork, I suggest you read the Getting Started guide, found at http://code.google.com/p/bznetwork/wiki/GettingStarted.

BZNetwork is still a work-in-progress. If you see anything in BZNetwork that is not included in this manual, make sure and file an issue on it at http://code.google.com/p/bznetwork/issues/entry. You will need a Google account to file an issue at that location.

If you have any questions after reading this manual, join #bztraining on irc.freenode.net and ask jcp.

This manual is organized into the following sections:
