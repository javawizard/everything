<h2>Actions</h2><p>
The actions page lets you view what other users have done on BZNetwork.
You can use it to make sure that users aren't doing things they
shouldn't be doing.</p><p>When you first view the actions page, you'll see a list of the most recent actions that have occurred on the site, most recent actions first. You can click on the arrow next to the details of any particular action to expand that action and see more about what happened.</p><p>There are two links at the top of the actions screen:<br></p><h3>Filter</h3><p>This link, sometimes appearing as "Filter on event ..." or "Filtering on event ... and user ...", allows you to filter which actions show up in the actions screen. You can filter by a particular event type or a particular user, or both at the same time. For example, you could view a list of users that have recently logged on to your site by filtering on the logged-in event. Or you could figure out what javawizard2539 has been up to on your site by filtering on the user callsign:javawizard2539 (usernames are prefixed with "callsign" if they are bzflag callsigns and "internal" if they are internal usernames). Either way, when you click the <b>Filter</b> link, a dialog will pop up where you can select a user to filter on and an event to filter on. Select <b>All users</b> if you don't want to filter on a user, and select the blank option in the event drop down box if you don't want to filter on an event. </p><h3>Clear action log<br></h3><p>This allows you to clear the action log of a particular user. If you're filtering on a user, then their action log will be cleared. If you're not filtering on a particular user, then the action logs of all users will be cleared. Be aware that when you clear a user's action log, an event will be logged indicating that you cleared their action log.<br></p></body>
