MORE RAMBLING FROM ME (ALEX) ON HOW INTOUCH3 WORKS

specifically, the different types of plugins.

there are a few different types of plugins build-in to InTouch 3. These are listed below.

workspace - A workspace plugin. these extend the class net.sf.convergia.client.workspace.Workspace .
More info coming soon.

tool - A workspace tool. these extend the class net.sf.convergia.client.toolworkspace.Tool .
More info coming soon.

lookandfeel (currently buggy but implemented) - A Swing look and feel plugin. these extend the class javax.swing.LookAndFeel .
The user can switch between any lookandfeel plugins and any jvm built-in plugins using a dialog
built in to InTouch 3. In the future, these plugins will also be able to specify another class which can
be used to open a dialog for configuring the look and feel.
On the login screen, there is a button to switch to the default look and feel if the current look and
feel has a problem that makes it so that you cannot log in.

feature (coming soon) - A generic feature. Only one instance of a feature class is instantiated per InTouch 3
instance. features can exchange messages with other users that have that feature installed. Features can add
menus to the InTouch 3 menu bar, tool workspace menu bars, etc., and can add a variety of controls elsewhere.
features cannot remove already-existing menus, though. in particular, features cannot add or remove controls
from the plugin manager window, and they cannot remove the plugin manager menu item from the InTouch 3 menu.
