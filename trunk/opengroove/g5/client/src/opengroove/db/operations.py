So, all of the operations have essentially the following methods:

apply(db, invert): Applies the changes represented by this operation to the
specified sqlite database representing the datastore. If invert is True, then 
a list of operations needed to undo this change is generated and returned. 

create(...): Static. The arguments are specific to the operation type, and can
be whatever would make sense. This returns a new instance of that operation
representing the arguments passed in.

decode(text): Static. Decodes the specified string into an instance of this class. 

encode(...): Encodes this instance into a string that can be passed to decode().
