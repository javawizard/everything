=!OpenGroove Database=
==Does OGDB have any sort of upsert operation?==
For attributes on objects, the *set* operation is an upsert. For objects themselves, an upsert can be emulated with an insert followed by a set. The insert will be ignored by the database if the object already exists.

=Code=
==What language is !OpenGroove written in?==
Python.

==What language do you write !OpenGroove plugins in?==
Python.

==Why does !OpenGroove use the "%" string operator all over the place even though it's deprecated?==
TODO: finish this, it's because % is more standard and their other formatting stuff is too python-specific

TODO: add a FAQ about why javawizard keeps failing and documenting stuff with the word "throw" when he means the word "raise" because he comes from java.
