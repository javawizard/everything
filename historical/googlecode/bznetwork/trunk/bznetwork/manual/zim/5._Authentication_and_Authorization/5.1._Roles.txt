====== 1. Roles ======
Created Saturday 22 August 2009

At the heart of the authentication and authorization system is the role. A role defines a set of permissions that will be applied to users when they have authenticated. A permission specifies a set of actions the user can carry out on a particular object. For example, a role could define that a user with that role can view the logs of a particular server.
