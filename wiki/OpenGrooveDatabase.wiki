==Operations==
Operations that a single change can represent:

===Insert===
This is an addition of a single object to the system. Included with this will be the type of the object, the id of the object, the path of the object's parent, and any attributes included with the initial version of the object. 

If an object in the parent object with the specified id already exists, the insert operation does nothing.

If an object with the specified parent id does not exist, the insert operation does nothing.

===Delete===
This is the removal of a single object from the system. If the object has any children, those children will be recursively removed as well.

Removal is performed based on the object's id. If an object with the specified id does not exist, the delete operation does nothing. 

Note that the root object (whose id is the empty string) cannot be deleted. A delete operation on the root object does nothing.

===Set===
This is the setting of a single attribute on an object to have a certain value. Objects are referenced by id, and attributes are referenced by name.

If the attribute does not already exist on the object, it is created. If the attribute already exists, it is set to the specified value.

If there is no such object with the specified id, this operation does nothing.

===Update===
This is the updating of a single attribute on an object. This is eqivalent to the *set* operation, but if the specified attribute does not already exist on the object, it will not be created, effectively meaning that the operation does nothing if the attribute does not already exist.

===Unset===
This is the deleting of a single attribute from an object. Objects are referenced by id, and attributes are referenced by name.

If an object with the specified id does not exist, this operation does nothing.

If the specified object does not have any attribute with the specified name, this operation does nothing.

==File Format==
The OpenGroove DB maintains a concept of two different storage locations: the version history and the datastore. The version history stores all of the changes that have occurred since the database was created, and the datastore stores what the database's current version looks like at present.  

==Version History=

==Datastore==
Currently, the datastore is backed by an SQLite database. In the future, it will use its own custom binary format, as the way it stores data in the SQLite database is somewhat inefficient.
