Then, these need to be imcorporated into WorkspaceManager and Workspace, so that a serverside workspace is created
whenever a workspace is created, and the corresponding serverside workspace is deleted when the local workspace is deleted.
Instead of checking for exceptions when creating or deleting, we should call canAccess() to see if creating or deleting
was successful.
We should only be allowed to create and delete workspaces when online, to avoid not creating or deleting a serverside
workspace that corresponds to this clientside workspace. Then, methods should be made available to implementations of
Workspace to allow them to read and write workspace properties. We don't need to add caching of these yet. Then
we should go ahead and work on MultiplayerSequenceGame. There will not be a game manager now, because the current player can
just set that it is the next player's turn as a property, and then the next player will read that and pick up the turn.
This poses a problem that if a game participant goes offline, then the game will be stuck on their turn, but we should
worry about that later, since it is not very likely right now. Then we should allow game participants to set some sort
of player metadata that all other players can read. Game participants and observers should be notified when the current
player changes. They should also be notified when the board object changes.
