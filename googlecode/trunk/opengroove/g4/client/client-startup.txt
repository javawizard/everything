When the client starts, it loads the tray icon and the notification frame. It then starts the thread that automatically garbage-collects. Then it checks to see if there are any users. If not, it prompts to create a user, storing config in a newly-created folder. If there are any users set to automatically log in, then it prompts for their password, or just logs them in if their password is to be remebered.

This then starts up a communicator, a User object for that user, a MessageManager, and a StoredMessageManager. It then sets up the launchbar. A lot of the launchbar code will probably be taken from G3, as well as a lot of the message management code.
