/**
 * This class is used to manage general settings for OpenGroove that the user
 * should be allowed to configure. The user opens up the Options window, and
 * then goes to the Settings tab. The settings available are listed there.
 * Settings can take the form of a font, a color, a piece of short text, a piece
 * of long text, a dropdown box, a list box, or a file chooser. Settings can be
 * grouped into sections, which are each shown in a panel with a titled border
 * around it.
