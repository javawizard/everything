This is a historical directory (and repository) containing the original
OpenGroove, the namesake project of my website (www.opengroove.org).

The project was originally tracked in a private subversion repository which has
since been lost to history. It was then tracked in a project on SourceForge;
the history of the project during these years is located under the sf
directory. It was then tracked on Google Code, the history of which is located
under googlecode.

NOTE: The contents of sf/client/main/updates/Release were removed after importing sf's history on account of their size. Have a look at d1dc9cd6368e187aa1b01f236cdc05e5e79a4990 if you want to see what that directory contained, but be prepared for a ~700 MB working copy when you do so.
