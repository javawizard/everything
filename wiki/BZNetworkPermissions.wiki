This file documents all permissions in the BZNetwork interface. Permissions have a level to which they apply. The available levels are global, group, and server. A permission may be applied to any individual entity above its level.

For example, view-logs is a server-level permission. This means that you typically grant view-logs on a per-server basis, or maybe on a per-group basis (allowing viewing of any logs within that group).
