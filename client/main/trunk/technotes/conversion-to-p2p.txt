Anyway, Connector is an interface. Service is also an interface.

What we need is a means to give an imessage to a service and ask it to deliver it to a specific user. It will either succeed or fail. Then we need a means to ask it to deliver a pmessage, in the form of an input stream, to a list of recipients, and a method for it to report which ones it could be sent to, and the reason why it couldn't send it to others. Valid reasons would be that the connector doesn't know how to deliver the message to that recipient, and that it was delivering the message but got interrupted. OpenGroove will immediately ask the service to re-deliver the message to the interrupted recipients. It will do this either until the maximum redelivery limit is reached, at which point it will treat the message as if the service didn't know how to deliver it, or until the service delivers the message.

A service is represented by a URI. It is ogservice:CONNECTOR?name=value. CONNECTOR is the connector's id, and all of the parameters are passed to the connector when asking it for a matching service.

A connector's list of supported services generally shouldn't change. For example, in the case of a connector that provides a service for each relay server it handles, it should provide services even if the computer is offline, and these services will reject messages on the grounds that they cannot get the message to the recipient. In other words, a service should only be unavailable for construction if the format of the URI passed to it is incorrect.
