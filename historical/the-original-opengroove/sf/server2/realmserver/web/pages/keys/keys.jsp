If this server is not listed in the public directory, clients that want to 
connect to it will need it's public key. You can download the public key by
clicking <a href="/serverkey.ogvs">here</a>. Make sure to provide this to all clients that
want to connect to your server. When distributing public keys, you must ensure
that they are not tampered with. However, a malicious attacker cannot use the
public key to cause damage to your system, so you don't need to take measures
to prevent it from being spread.<br/>
