MORE RAMBLE FROM ME ABOUT HOW INTOUCH3 WORKS

***THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET

it3sr:// urls are urls that download the content from the server. the user
can download content even when they are not authenticated. to download a specified
resource, you connect to the server on the port specified (if the server's name is default,
then the default server is assumed, and if the port is not specified, the default port is assumed)
and send __resource as the first line, instead of your username. the server will not send a
response. then you send a line which is the resource to download, starting with a forward slash.
for example, is the url is it3sr://trivergia.com:64482/some/url or if the url is
it3sr://default/some/url then the 2nd line passed to the server would be /some/url .
query parameters are allowed, sent in the usual manner, appended to the end of a url
after a questionmark, separated by ampersands, and the key separated from the value by
an equals sign. the server responds with one line of text which starts with OK or FAIL.
if it was OK, then the rest of the text (after the newline) is the resource. if it was FAIL,
then immediately after FAIL (on the same line) is either NOEXIST or ERROR. NOEXIST is sent
if the resource was not found, and ERROR is sent if there was an error while getting the resource.
those could be comparable to HTTP codes 404 and 500, respectively. after that on the same line
may be a description of the problem, for example, FAIL ERROR an exception was thrown when
getting the resource. 

as per the protocol specification, the path (everything after the host and port but before
the query parameters, /some/url in the above examples) can be anything, but currently the
InTouch 3 server uses the first folder component ("some" in the above examples) as the
resource handler identifier. more info on this is given in the documentation for the server.
