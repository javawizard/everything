/**
 * A store that can be used to create temporary files. I created this class
 * since File.createTempFile() has a habit of throwing an IOException every once
 * in a while, and because if I use my own class I can delete all temporary
 * files when the VM is first loaded, since they aren't ever used across
 * multiple VM invocations.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * 
 * Temporary files created by this class will be marked as deleteOnExit.
 * Temporary folders created by this class won't have this property; they will,
 * however, be deleted the next time the VM starts up and the file store is
 * used.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * 
 * The first time (in a particular VM invocation) this class is used, it will
 * attempt to delete all files that are in the store, to get rid of any files
 * that might not have been deleted by the VM when it exited. It will also do
 * this for directories. Thereafter, files will not be deleted until the next VM
 * restart or shutdown.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * 
 * This class does not register a shutdown hook to delete files, so they could
 * persist after VM shutdown.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * 
 * If this class is not initialized with a file store to use before it is
 * accessed for the first time, then it will use the store
 * "storage/tmp/filestore". <br/>
 * <br/>
 * 
 * The current user must have write permissions to the parent folder of the file
 * store, not just write permissions to the file store itself.
