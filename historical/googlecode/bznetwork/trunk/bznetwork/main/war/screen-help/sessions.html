<h2>Sessions</h2>The sessions page allows you to view the list of users that are currently logged into your site. You can view details about their IP address, the authentication provider that they used to log in (see <a href="authentication.html">Authentication</a>), their username, the roles that are applied to them, the user agent that they're using to visit your site (IE what browser and operating system they're using), the time at which they logged in, and the time at which they last performed an action (such as clicking a link or saving information) on your site. You can also kick a user off of the site. Kicking a user off of the site causes the site, as viewed by the user that was kicked off, to act exactly as if their session had timed out. You could use this, for example, to kick yourself out of the site if you logged in at a public computer but forgot to log out. To kick a user out, you use the <b>Force logout</b> button.<br>
