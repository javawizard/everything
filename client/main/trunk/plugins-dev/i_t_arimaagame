name=3D Flying Pencils Game
description=<html>\
A 3D flying pencil game. Each user is shown on the<br/>\
screen as a pencil-like object that can fly in 3D space.<br/>\
Average scores are kept track of, in average kills per<br/>\
minute of online time. Each user has a health meter<br/>\
which has marks taken off when the user is hit. when<br/>\
the user's health meter is depleted, the user is "killed"<br/>\
and they move back to the start position. users can shoot<br/>\
at other users. the farther a shot travels, the bigger it<br/>\
gets, but less marks will be taken from any users who get hit.<br/>\
<br/>\
Java3D is required to use this tool. If you don't have Java3D,<br/>\
you can get it at http://java.sun.com/
