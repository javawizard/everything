*XSM: Xml Programming Language*

=Description=
XSM is a programming language written in XML. It will be used as the embedded programming language inside OpenGroove's help pages. The main reason is that the help pages need a small server-side scripting language (JSP is too heavyweight for this one, and I'm not inclined to jump through the hoops required to get it working in an embedded environment without TCP sockets being needed, and I implemented a Logo programming language interpreter in a single night so an XML programming language for which there are already syntax parsers can't be that difficult) that can be used to embed dynamic help content. This language needs to be independent of the help source (be it the opengroove wiki or files within a plugin), and should preferably be a language that will get ignored by Google Code's wiki parser. An XML-based programming language works nicely for this. <xsm>something</xsm>
