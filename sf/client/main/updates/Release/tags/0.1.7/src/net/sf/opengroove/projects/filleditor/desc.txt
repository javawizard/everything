FillEditor is a simple image editor. All it allows you to do is define regions, as a list of points (which can either be taken as a polygon or have a bezier curve applied), and set a fill for a region. Regions can overlap, and the ordering of regions can be specified. Plugins can be added, which provide a different type of fill. When a new image is created, it initially has a white background. The background color can be set. Then, layers can be defined. A layer is defined by typing a name for the layer, and clicking OK. Then, a layer can be defined. When it is defined, it erases all of it's current points, and allows the user to click on the image until they've specified all of the points they want. They then click a button indicating that they are done. They can then set the layer's fill type, and edit the particular fill's parameters. When they have finished editing the image, they can export it to a .png file, or they can save it as a .fdsc file that they can edit later.
