This file documents all permissions in the BZNetwork interface. Permissions have a level to which they apply. The available levels are global, group, and server. A permission may be applied to any individual entity above its level. Some permissions also take arguments. These are stored in the database as a single string, and convention dictates that different actual parameters be stored in pipe-delimited spaces in that string.

For example, view-logs is a server-level permission. This means that you typically grant view-logs on a per-server basis, or maybe on a per-group basis (allowing viewing of any logs within that group).

=Available permissions=
Here is the list of available permissions and what they do. At the bottom of the table is a list of sensitive permissions. Sensitive permissions are those that generally allow a user to take full control of the server with them.

|| *Permission*            || *Level* || *Description* ||
|| manage-users            || global  ||Allows the user to add, edit, and delete internal users, and set a particular user's role.||
|| manage-roles            || global  ||Allows the user to add, and delete roles and edit the permissions applied to each role.||
|| manage-auth             || global  ||Allows the user to manage which authentication providers are enabled on the server, and select what the default provider is or if there is a default.     ||
|| view-logs               || server  ||Allows the user to view the logs of a server, and to view the server's chat in real time via the web interface. NOTE: As a side note, I'm thinking that the user might be able to select how they want to view the logs: in a grid style ("grid"), or in a console style ("console"). Grid shows chat and such like norang's log interface, and Console shows chat as if the user was watching a bzflag console. They're both just different modes of displaying stuff.||
|| view-user               || global  ||Allows the user to view information about a particular bzflag user that has visited a server.||
|| cross-reference-user    || global  ||Allows the user to cross-reference users. This shows them the list of ip address that the user has signed on, and allows them to look up an ip address and see the users that have signed on from it.||
|| edit-map                || server  ||Allows the user to manage the map of a server.||
|| edit-groupdb            || server  ||Allows the user to edit the group db of a server.||
|| inherit-parent-groupdb  || server  ||Allows the user to select whether a server also inherits its group's groupdb.||
|| edit-group-groupdb      || group   ||Allows the user to edit a particular group's groupdb.||
|| edit-server-settings    || server  ||Allows the user to edit general settings about the server.||
|| manage-callsign-auth    || global  ||Allows the user to manage the mapping of a particular bzflag authentication group with the role that applies to it, and the mapping of a particular bzflag callsign with the role that applies to it (in addition to any roles applied by the callsign's groups).||
|| start-stop-server       || server  ||Allows the user to start, stop, and restart a server.||
|| create-server           || group   ||Allows the user to create a new server in a given group. They won't, however, be granted any permissions on the server, so it's recommended that people with create-server also receive any other server-related permissions on the group that they have create-server on.||
|| delete-server           || group   ||Allows the user to delete servers within the group. This could technically be applied on a per-server level, but it seems somewhat pointless to do that, and there are some technical issues involved.||
|| add-group-ipban         || group   ||Allows the user to add IP bans to a group banfile. This takes one parameter which is the maximum duration, in seconds, that the user can ban for.||
|| add-group-idban         || group   ||Same as add-group-ipban, but for BZID bans.||
|| add-group-hostban       || group   ||Same as add-group-ipban, but for hostnames.||
|| delete-group-ban        || group   ||Allows the user to delete bans from a group banfile.||
|| delete-self-group-ban   || group   ||Allows the user to delete bans from a group banfile that they added themselves.||
|| view-reports            || server  ||Allows the user to view reports made on a particular server.||
|| say                     || server  ||Allows the user to say something on the actual server. The message will appear as if coming from the server, but will be prefixed with the user's username plus a colon. The last character of the message must not be a close-parenthesis (with trailing whitespace removed)., to prevent spoofing of the in-game /say command.||
|| hidden-say              || server  ||Allows the user to say something on the actual server. Unlike the say permission, the message can be anything (and it can end with a close-parenthesis), and it will not be prefixed.||
|| view-in-server-list     || server  ||Allows the user to view a particular server in the server list. This also allows them to view the users currently logged into the server, and in the future their ip addresses. Most other server-related permissions are pointless without this one.||

The following permissions are sensitive:
 * *manage-users:* The user can apply any role to their own account, allowing them to gain the highest possible level of access of anyone on the server.
 * *manage-roles:* The user can add any permissions they want to their own role.
 * *manage-auth:* This one is only sensitive if the server owner doesn't take some precautions. If the server owner doesn't remove the internal admin account, but disables the internal authentication provider (assuming that this will prevent other users from gaining permissions through use of the admin account), then a user with manage-auth can re-enable the provider and gain full access.
