The Data Container Format is a system for mapping structured data to a byte-level representation. It is similar to the ProxyStorage system in that you define data formats as a set of interfaces, and then DCF takes care of converting instances of those interfaces to DataBlocks and vice versa. DCF is also suitable for applications where the data to be stored could contain gigabytes of data, and DCF will cache the data in a file to avoid an OutOfMemoryError.
