G4 is the 4th generation of OpenGroove (aka the fourth rewrite). I know that's a lot of rewrites.

Anyway, I think I started to write the kitchen sink into generation 3 (the first one known as OpenGroove; generation 1 was known as InTouch and generation 2 was known as Convergia). This made it not really feasible to complete. I'm going to simplify dramatically for G4.

So anyway, I'm going to simplify things quite a bit. Organizations have to run a G4 server; if it gets big I'll add a public server and options to create new accounts.

Contacts can't be edited. A user's "contact" list is a list of all users on the server.

Users are stored in a properties file, mapping usernames to hashed passwords. Users, for now, can't be edited via any sort of UI.

Like MS Groove, the server will only support stored messages. Also like groove, the server will only store a complete message, not a partially uploaded one.

Clients won't have security keys for now, and clients must not connect from multiple computers. SSL will be used to encrypt data as it goes over the wire.

The server has a message store for allowing clients to exchange stored messages. A client that wants to send a stored message from one user to another connects to the messaging socket and sends the message or receives one.

All workspace data is stored as a master copy on the server. The dynamics system concept is still used to provide concurrency, but everything synchronizes against the server. So this means that engines run commands on a server, and the server stores all command history back until the last synchronization with the oldest-synchronzied client.

Workspaces currently have managers, participants, and guests. Managers can read and write the workspace and can modify its user list (including who else are managers/participants/guests). Participants can read and write the workspace, but they can't modify the user list. Guests can only read the workspace, and the server won't let them write it.

Workspaces cannot be created by the client right now; they can only be created on the server. Also, I'm thinking that the list of users in a workspace can only be modified on the server, not by users.
