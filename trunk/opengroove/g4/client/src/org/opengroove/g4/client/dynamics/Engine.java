 * and write it to disk but not read it, and this will not have any problems.<br/>

 * 
 * Engines must not modify or read data in any other code except that in the
 * applyCommand and applyRevert methods, or methods called by those methods. In
 * particular, engines must never start threads that periodically read or modify
 * data in the engine.
