Currently, the only way to share a workspace is to add the user(s) you want to share the workspace with to the allowed user
list for that workspace, and then send those users the ID of the workspace over email, telephone, or another means of communication.
in the future, we are planning on allowing you to send a workspace invitation using InTouch 3 to another user.<br/>
<br/>
Click on the settings icon next to the workspace you would like to share. When the Configure Workspace window opens, go to the
users tab. there you will see two lists, one of the users that you have allowed to participate in the workspace,
and the other of those users who have decided to participate. click the add button, then type the username of the user
you want to share the workspace with. then click ok. you may do this as many times as you want. when you have added
all of the users you want to share the workspace with, contact each of those users, and give them the workspace's id.
you can view the workspace's id by clicking on the settings icon for the workspace. the id will show up in the configure workspace window.
when those users receive your workspace's id, they should click participate in a workspace in the launchbar. then they should enter
your workspace's id. your workspace will appear in their launchbar.<br/>
<br/>
You can also invite a user to a workspace without having to send them it's ID. This option is only available if you are the workspace creator.
click on the invite to workspace icon next to the workspace in the launchbar. type the username of the user that you wish to invite
to the workspace, and optionally a short message. then click send.
