This project (OpenGroove Mobile, http://svn.opengroove.org/mobile/client1/trunk) is an attempt at a scaled-down client that runs on a mobile phone. The client can receive and send messages, and can view workspaces with a  plugin present for a mobile phone. The mobile phone would read messages but not delete them unless the user is willing to go without them in their message history, so the messages still take up inbound cache space. More information on this later.
