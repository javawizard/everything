This is the list of packet types. The number at the beginning is the decimal value that is assigned to that packet type. 



01 - client hello

This packet is the first one sent once communication with the server has been established, and is sent by the client. It contains the string "bzsound/1.0", followed by a newline. This allows the server to distinguish a bzsound client from an http client, and therefore potentially serve http resources over the same port in the future. 



02 - server hello

This packet is sent in response to the client's client hello packet. It contains the string "bzsound/1.0", but without a newline at the end. This is always the second packet sent.



20 - client voice update

This packet contains actual audio data from the client. The first byte is the number of samples per second the data was captured at, in khz. This should either be 8 or 16 for now. The second byte is the number of bytes for each sample. This should either be 1 or 2 for now. Every byte after that is sample data.
