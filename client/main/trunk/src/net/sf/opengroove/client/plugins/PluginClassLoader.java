/**
 * This class is used to load plugin classes. A PluginClassLoader is created for
 * each plugin (except for internal ones), and this class loader is used to load
 * all of the plugin's classes.<br/><br/>
 * 
 * When the plugin manager loads, it performs general tasks such as validating
 * plugin signatures, etc. Some time after, it creates an instance of this class
 * for each plugin that is not an internal plugin. For internal plugins, it uses
 * the class loader used to load the plugin manager, which should be the
 * bootstrap class loader and therefore the class loader used to load the
 * OpenGroove classes themselves. Anyway, the plugin manager creates an instance
 * of this class, passing into it the location of the jar file that contains the
 * plugin. The plugin manager then creates class loaders for all the other
 * plugins. It then calls addDependancy() on each of these class loaders to
 * register the other class loaders upon which this class loader is dependant.
 * After this is done, the class loader is ready for use. When a class is to be
 * resolved, it first looks in the bootstrap class loader for an appropriate
 * class. If it finds one, it returns it. If it does not, it then looks in it's
 * cache of loaded classes (stored as a hashtable). If it finds the class there,
 * it returns it. If not, it checks to see if the class specified is in the
 * plugin's jar file. If it's there, it loads it, sticks it into the hashtable,
 * and returns it. If it isn't, then it calls each of it's dependency class
 * loaders to see if they have the class, specifying that they are to only
 * return their classes, and not themselves check their dependancies. If a class
 * is found there, it is returned. If no classes could be found in the
 * dependancies, then a ClassNotFoundException is thrown.
