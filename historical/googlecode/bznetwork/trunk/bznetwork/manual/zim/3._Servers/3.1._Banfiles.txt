====== 1. Banfiles ======
Created Saturday 22 August 2009

Jumping in to the topic of banfiles without covering the topic of servers might seem rather strange. There is a very good reason for doing so, which is that a server will not start unless it has a banfile. This merits a discussion into the topic of banfiles. 

BZNetwork allows individual banfiles to be maintained. These banfiles are all independent of one another; bans do not transfer from one banfile to another. Multiple servers can use any given banfile, and BZNetwork will automatically load the serverControl plugin to keep the servers properly synchronized.
