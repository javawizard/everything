The storage tree has some folders under it. 

Under the storage folder is auth. This currently holds one file, users.props. This is a properties file of usernames to hashed passwords.

When a user opens a socket to the server to send a message, a new file is created in messagecache, using the message's id. When the message has been successfully received, the file is copied over to messages/<username>, where <username> is the recipient's username.

Message ids must start with the user's username and then a hyphen.
