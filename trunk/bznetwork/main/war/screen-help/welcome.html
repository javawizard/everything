<h2>Welcome</h2><p>The welcome page shows a message to users when they visit your site. It's only visible to users that have logged in, although in the future when I get public-site support working, this page will be visible to everyone.</p><p>If you're viewing this page by clicking on a <b>Help</b> link in the upper-right corner of your page, it's probably worth mentioning that each page in the site (you access different pages either by using the <b>Menu</b> link in the upper-right corner or by clicking on the links at the far left side of the page) has its own help content. This help page is specific to the <b>Welcome</b> page. So check out some other pages, and then use the help link on those.<br></p>
