<h2>Authgroups</h2><p>The Authgroups page is where you can apply roles to BZFlag groups. It shows a list of all of the groups that have a role applied to them, and allows you to apply a role to a new group. See <a href="roles.html">Roles</a> for more information on what roles are.</p><p>To apply a role to a BZFlag group, type the name of the group in the text box on the screen, and select the role in the dropdown box. Then click Add. The role will then be applied to that BZFlag group, and all users that log in that are members of that group will have the permissions from that role applied to them.<br></p></body></html>
