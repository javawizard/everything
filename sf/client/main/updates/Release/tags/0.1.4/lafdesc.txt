MORE RAMBLING FROM ME ON HOW INTOUCH3 WORKS

specifically, on how look and feels work

As is typical of all plugins, when a look and feel is downloaded and installed (in the InTouch 3 sense, not in the swing UI manager sense)
it does not take effect until InTouch 3 is restarted. when InTouch 3 starts, just after PluginManager.loadPlugins() is called,
all of the lookandfeel plugins are installed into UIManager. then, the value of the user config property lookandfeel
is used as the classname (not the plugin name) of the look and feel to use.

currently, there is no support for metal themes, but expect this to be present in future releases.
