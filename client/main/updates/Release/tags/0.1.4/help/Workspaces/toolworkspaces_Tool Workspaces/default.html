Tool workspaces are the most common type of workspace, and you will probably create these the most. They allow you to
add "tools", small applications, to them. Each tool shows up as a tab within the tool workspace. Tool workspaces
also have a chat window. <b>Chat has not been implemented yet</b>, but we expect it to be soon. You can also
see the other members of the workspace, and who is currently using the tool workspace.
